## Introduction:
This project explores the allometry and morphology of various ecomorphs within *Anolis*, a genus of reptiles that is remarkably diverse both in species richness and their radiations. An ecomorph is a categorization of multiple species according to their ecological niche, as well as behavior. The anole radiation throughout habitats (including distinct islands and within islands themselves) makes them a useful model organism to study their allometry. In fact, studies performed in @hagey2017there have generated a sizeable database of anole observations across different species and ecomorphs.  
The central question here is: **How does hind limb length vary with size?** Other related questions delve further into determining potential predictors of this relationship, and correcting for phylogenetic factors.
This will be answered by data analysis, both through direct visualization and model design (and model assessment).

## Methods:
In total, 46 anole species were analyzed morphologically, ecomorphologically, and phylogenetically. Size was approximated as SVL, or snout-vent length, while hind limb length, or HTotal, was measured as the average total hind limb length (from the upper leg to the longest digit). Phylogenetic models were constructed as having traits evolving under either Brownian or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models, varying independence of co-variables (linear vs. allometric) and analyzed using a phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) procedure.

The phylogenetic tree of *Anolis* species was obtained from @poe2017aphylogenetic to perform phylogenetic generalized least squares, while the species morphological and ecological data came from @hagey2017there.

Linear models follow the format $HTotal=SVL x+\beta$.
Non-linear allometric models follow the format $HTotal=\alpha*SVL^\beta$.


## Results:
The phylogenetic models were constructed and identified with the following code. Note the inclusion or absence of ecomorph as a covariate.
```{r, "load the data", include = FALSE}
anole <- read_csv("anole.dat.csv")
anole.eco <- read_csv("anole.eco.csv")
anole.tree <- read.tree("anole.tre")
```
```{r, "join, filter, mutate to log", include=FALSE}
anole2 <- anole %>%
  left_join(anole.eco) %>%
  filter(!Ecomorph%in%c("U", "CH")) %>%
  na.omit()
anole.log <- anole2 %>%
  mutate_at(c("SVL", "HTotal", "PH", "ArbPD"),log)
```
```{r, "PGLS models"}
### phylogenetic GLS models
#PGLS under BM, no ecomorph:
pgls.BM1 <- gls(HTotal~SVL, correlation = corBrownian(1,phy=anole.tree, form=~Species), data=anole.log, method="ML")
#PGLS under BM, with ecomorph:
pgls.BM2 <- gls(HTotal~SVL*Ecomorph2, correlation=corBrownian(1,phy=anole.tree,form=~Species), data=anole.log, method="ML")
#PGLS under OU, no ecomorph:
pgls.OU1 <- gls(HTotal~SVL, correlation=corMartins(0,phy=anole.tree, form=~Species), data=anole.log, method="ML")
#PGLS under OU, with ecomorph:
pgls.OU2 <- gls(HTotal~SVL*Ecomorph2, correlation=corMartins(0,phy=anole.tree, form=~Species), data=anole.log, method="ML")
```

The models' fit to the data was then assessed using the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion):
```{r, "AIC", echo=FALSE}
#AIC operations
anole.phylo.aic <- AICc(pgls.BM1, pgls.BM2, pgls.OU1, pgls.OU2)
anole.phylow.aicw <- aicw(anole.phylo.aic$AICc) %>%
  mutate(model = c("pgls.BM1", "pgls.BM2", "pgls.OU1", "pgls.OU2")) %>%
  dplyr::select(model, everything())
kable(anole.phylow.aicw, caption = "Table 1: AIC results for varying linear or allometric models")
```
```{r, regression plot of log-transformed HTotal vs. SVL, echo=FALSE}
regression_plot <- anole.log %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = log(SVL), y = log(HTotal), color = Ecomorph2)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', formula = y ~ x, se = TRUE) +  # Add se = TRUE for shaded CI
  labs(x = "log(SVL)", y = "log(HTotal)", color = "Ecomorph2") +
  theme_minimal() + ggtitle(" Figure 1: Regression Plot of Log-Transformed HTotal vs. SVL Data by Ecomorph")
print(regression_plot)
```

```{r, "add residuals", echo=FALSE}
#add phylo-corrected residuals
anole.log <- anole.log %>%
  mutate(phylo.res = residuals(pgls.BM2))
```
```{r, "plot residuals", echo=FALSE}
#plot residuals
p.eco.phylo <- anole.log %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Ecomorph2, y = phylo.res)) + geom_boxplot() + stat_summary(fun=mean, geom="point", size=3) + ggtitle("Figure 2: Phylogenetically-Corrected Residuals for Ecomorphs")
print(p.eco.phylo)
```


## Discussion:
Our analysis and findings provide insight into the intriguing association between body size and hind limb length in the diverse genus *Anolis*. Our inquiry into the allometric patterns within this taxon was led by our fundamental question, "How does hind limb length vary with size?" 
While the framework for our debate is supplied by our statistical models, we must wait for the actual outcomes of our analysis before making any firm judgments. On the basis of our study strategy, we can highlight some potential consequences and hypotheses.
We used phylogenetic models under both Brownian Motion (BM) and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes to analyze the allometric connection between hind limb length (HTotal) and size (SVL) in *Anolis* lizards, taking into account the impact of ecomorph categories. The AIC results offered insights into how the models fit the data. Notably, our results show that the model's fit is much enhanced by the inclusion of ecomorph information, as shown by the significantly reduced AIC value in the pgls.BM2 model. This suggests that ecomorph is a significant predictor in how the length of the hind limbs varies within the *Anolis* genus. 
The models (pgls.BM1 and pgls.OU1) that did not include ecomorph information, on the other hand, showed comparably higher AIC values, suggesting that they might not be able to fully capture the underlying patterns in the data. 
A boxplot of phylogenetically adjusted hindlimb residuals versus anole ecomorph showed interesting trends. It showed that some ecomorphs have more variety in their hind limb length residuals, indicating that they might have particular adaptations for movement and habitat usage. These differences within the *Anolis* genus might be an indication of selective forces connected to particular ecological niches. Additionally, potential discrepancies in the representation of species across ecomorph categories were highlighted in the table that showed the species count by ecomorph. We must take into account the possibility of biases introduced by such imbalances when interpreting our results. Our first findings opened doors for further research into the complex relationship between body size, ecomorphology, and hind limb length in *Anolis* lizards.
